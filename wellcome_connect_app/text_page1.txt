<h4> Results presented here are based on a logistic multilevel model with</h4> 

<ul>
<li> Random intercept  (allows each individual to have different initial probability of depression)</li>

<li> Random slope (allows each individual to have their own trajectory in time)</li>

<li> Non-linear change in time (includes square effects)</li>
</ul>
